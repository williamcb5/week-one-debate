There is a very comon misconseption the amozon is burning.
the amozon is not burning, it is being burnt, and it is being burnt for a very specific reason.
large ranching industries are creating man made fires to expand thier fields for cattle.
this has been a movment to combat poverty.
with brazil currently in an economic recession 30% of households have a varying degree food insecurity.
thats over 70,000,000 that are living in some state of poverty
the presedent, Jair Bolsonaro, has actually stated that he dosent want people to stop the forest from burning.\
we have only used 16percent of the amozon.
people have only taken intrest to the amozon becuse its burning a little more then average
the presedent of brazil know that this is posibly the only way to battle poverty.


the lungs of the earth
most of the oxogen in world
belive people will die
